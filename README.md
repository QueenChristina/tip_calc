# Tip Calculator 

## *Christina*

**Tippy** computes the tip and total amount for a bill. The app uses the base amount and tip percentage to calculate the amount owed, and it also describes the quality of service based on the tip.

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can enter in a bill amount (total amount to tip on)
* [X] User can enter a tip percentage (what % the user wants to tip).
* [X] The tip and total amount are updated immediately when any of the inputs changes.
* [X] The user sees a label or color update based on the tip amount. 

The following **extensions** are implemented:

* [X] Custom colors palette selected
* [X] Added star image for extra oomph! :)

## Notes

As my first app made in android studio, I am proud of making it through the initial indimidation of starting a new project! It was a great experience, despite the occasional frustration of debugging crashes.
